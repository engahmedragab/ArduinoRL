</a>

The agent gets to control a six degrees-of-freedom arm. The joints have different ranges of motion, as determined by the physical constraints of the arm. A current sensor provides instantaneous current consumption readings.

## Task

The agent must execute pose transitions using as little energy as possible.

## Approach and Performance
